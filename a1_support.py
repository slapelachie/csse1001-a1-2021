    Returns the game solution as a single string.

    The game solution is the combination of a series of words randomly
    selected from the given words file.
    The amount of words the solution is composed of is equal to grid_size.
    Each word is the length of grid_size.

    e.g. If grid_size is 3, a possible returned solution is catdogpig which is
    a combination of 3 words of length 3.

    Parameters:
        file_name (str): Name of file from which words are loaded.
        grid_size (int): Size of the puzzle's grid, this determines the size of
                         words used in the puzzle.

    Returns:
